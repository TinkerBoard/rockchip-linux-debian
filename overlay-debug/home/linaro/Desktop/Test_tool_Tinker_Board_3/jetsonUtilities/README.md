# jetsonUtilities
This repository holds utilities for working with NVIDIA Jetson Development Kit

# jetsonInfo
Get information about the NVIDIA Jetson OS environment on NVIDIA Jetson Development Kits (TX1, TX2, AGX Xavier, Xavier NX, Nano, Nano 2GB)

The information about the NVIDIA Jetson Development Kit operating system is spread over a few files. This is a handy tool to use for reference.

The Python script jetsoninfo.py will list the hardware, version of L4T that is running, Ubuntu version, and the Linux kernel revision. To execute:
```
$ python jetsonInfo.py
```
or
```
$ python3 jetsonInfo.py
```
or
```
$ ./jetsonInfo.py 
```
The hardware designator is derived from the file: '/proc/cpuinfo'

The L4T version is derived from the file: '/etc/nv_tegra_release'

The Ubuntu version is derived from the file: '/etc/os-release'

The Linux kernel version is derived from the file: '/proc/version'
